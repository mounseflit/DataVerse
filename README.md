## üìñ **Project Overview**  

In schools and universities, it is often challenging to recommend academic resources due to the lack of alignment between department courses, required skills, gained skills, and professors' expertise. This project aims to address this issue by developing an innovative web application powered by Machine Learning to provide personalized academic resource recommendations.  

**Key Objectives:**  
- Build a cluster-based recommendation system using Machine Learning.  
- Develop advanced resource management and statistical analysis features to enhance decision-making for administrators.  
- Ensure optimal usability and security within a web application framework.

## üéØ **Main Features**  

1. **Machine Learning Recommendation System**  
   - Develop a clustering model to recommend academic resources based on student needs.  
   - Evaluate models using performance metrics like Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.  

2. **Backend Functionality**  
   - Implement RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on courses and professors.  
   - Enable Machine Learning predictions via API endpoints.  
   - Provide statistical insights through dynamic visualizations.  

3. **Frontend Interface**  
   - Admin dashboard for resource management and statistical visualization.  
   - Professor dashboard for course-related notifications and updates.  
   - Authentication and secure user management.
