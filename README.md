# Academic Resource Recommendation System  
**Welcome to the "Open Source and Dataverse" Hackathon!**  

This document provides an overview of the Academic Resource Recommendation System project. It details the objectives, features, and implementation phases for the system, as well as how participants can contribute to its development.

## üìñ **Project Overview**  

In schools and universities, it is often challenging to recommend academic resources due to the lack of alignment between department courses, required skills, gained skills, and professors' expertise. This project aims to address this issue by developing an innovative web application powered by Machine Learning to provide personalized academic resource recommendations.  

**Key Objectives:**  
- Build a cluster-based recommendation system using Machine Learning.  
- Develop advanced resource management and statistical analysis features to enhance decision-making for administrators.  
- Ensure optimal usability and security within a web application framework.

## üéØ **Main Features**  

1. **Machine Learning Recommendation System**  
   - Develop a clustering model to recommend academic resources based on student needs.  
   - Evaluate models using performance metrics like Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.  

2. **Backend Functionality**  
   - Implement RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on courses and professors.  
   - Enable Machine Learning predictions via API endpoints.  
   - Provide statistical insights through dynamic visualizations.  

3. **Frontend Interface**  
   - Admin dashboard for resource management and statistical visualization.  
   - Professor dashboard for course-related notifications and updates.  
   - Authentication and secure user management.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Structure**  

### **1. Machine Learning (Cluster-Based Recommendation System)**  
- **Data Preparation**:  
  - Clean and preprocess data for consistency and usability.  
  - Encode categorical variables and engineer features for optimal performance.  

- **Modeling**:  
  - Train clustering algorithms and evaluate using Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.  
  - Export the trained model in `.pkl` or `.h5` format for deployment.  

- **Deployment**:  
  - Integrate the model into the backend via RESTful APIs for real-time predictions.
